# sudoku-solver

## solves simple sudoku puzzles for the moment, will not continue if the puzzle reaches a point where it needs to branch and try multiple values. The gui is VERY basic,
just inserts inner html into editable table. Probably NOT safe at all, but I just wanted to get the thing working.
